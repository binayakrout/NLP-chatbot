    "To host our NLP model for Intent classification, Name Entity recognition and dialogue flow manager, Flask API framework is choosen. Flask is python web development framework with an inbuilt web server, using which APIs are developed using different machine learning python libraries such as tensorflow, nltk, sklearn, keras, spacy etc. Flask is chosen as our serving model not only because it is easy to integrate with web pages and takes little effort to make a application up and running with API end points but also it is comparatively flexible and readable than anyother API deployment models. We did explore other  machine learning deployment model service such as FastAPI, Seldon Core, DeepDetect etc in which few of them focus only on serving one component and few are complex to understand and implement. FastAPI is known for its performance, but is relatively new, not many resources were available for achieving our goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "As our goal was to make a custom UI to serve our chatbot model, Flask was the right choice as it gives more flexibility to work with html pages and smooth dataflow between UI and backend. The application deployment is also easy and fast with Flask API. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we are going with docker deployment, base images for building a flask application(eg.python:3.8-slim-buster) are readily available in docker hub and installing the python libraries and making the application run as a container is quite easily acheviable."

    "### Using Heuristics for Dialogue flow Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "For Dialogue Flow, We used multiple models such as RNN(Recurrent Neural Network), LSTM(Long-Short Term Memory) and did encoding/decoding too for the dialogue flow management. For our dataset, we don't have responses for the questions being asked. Using models such as RNN,LSTM, was difficult to generate text from these models. And without proper pre-defined responses and enough data, it was difficult to train the RNN/LSTM models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence we decided to proceed with rule-based/Heuristics approach for Dialogue Manager. This method gets the intent and Entities for the given query, and using the heuristics, generates response easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, since we dont have the output of the input queries in our dataset, we defined a format in the reply message based on the intents and entities and displaying the other values such as flight names, flight fares, air craft prices as a random value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the exact details of the flights names, timings, fares etc could be maintained in a database and using our intents and NERs, the exact value of each could be fetched using the queries and replaced in the random values that we display\n",
    "\n",
    "As it is not a model, it doesn't keep any history of previous conversations yet. We could however make a mechanism to keep history of the conversation and also check if the user directs the question to some other topic other than what the bot is trained for. "
